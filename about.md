# About me
My name is Maxim Van de Wynckel, and I am a PhD candidate at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://vub.be) in the [Web & Information Systems Engineering (WISE) Lab](https://wise.vub.ac.be). My research primarily focuses on **hybrid and indoor positioning**, **interoperability**, **linked data**, and methods for **discovering services**. Early in my career, I developed a fascination for integrating various technologies. Location data, in particular, offers a rich source for implicit human-computer interaction. However, I observed significant challenges in enabling seamless communication between different technologies. My focus on interoperability aims to bridge these gaps, facilitating effective and beneficial connections.

I graduated with great distinction from the [Erasmushogeschool Brussels](https://www.erasmushogeschool.be/en) in 2016, earning a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science. Subsequently, I obtained a Master of Science in Applied Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 2019, also with great distinction. My Master's thesis, titled *[Indoor Navigation by Centralized Tracking](/publications/2019/thesis)*, laid the foundation for my PhD research. Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Beat Signer, I am investigating hybrid positioning systems and the interoperability of these systems.

I am a key contributor to the development of the open-source hybrid positioning system, [OpenHPS](https://openhps.org), which was launched in 2020. In 2022, I designed the [POSO ontology](https://poso.openhps.org), providing a vocabulary for describing positioning systems, their algorithms, and the data they produce. In 2023, I introduced the [SemBeacon](https://sembeacon.org) Bluetooth Low Energy specification, aimed at creating semantic beacons for tracking and describing persons, objects, and environments. I am currently working towards my dissertation on the Discoverability and Interoperability of Indoor Positioning Systems, which I expect to defend before the summer of 2025.

In addition to my PhD research, I serve as a teaching assistant for various bachelor and master courses, including [Web Technologies](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/web-technologies), Databases, [Next Generation User Interfaces](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/next-generation-user-interfaces), and [Advanced Topics in Big Data](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/advanced-topics-big-data). I have also previously assisted in courses such as [Information Visualisation](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/information-visualisation) and Open Information Systems. Furthermore, I supervise Bachelor and Master theses related to my research domain.

My current hobbies include addative manufacturing, electronics, and scuba diving. I am the creator and maintainer of the current website of the [V.U.B. Diving Center vzw](https://www.vubdivingcenter.be) and I also help beginning divers to prepare their pool-exercises. I take pictures during some of my dives, for a small selection of those pictures, check my Adobe Portfolio [here](https://diving.maximvdw.be).
