# About me
Maxim Van de Wynckel is a PhD candidate at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://vub.be) in the [Web & Information Systems Engineering (WISE) Lab](https://wise.vub.ac.be). His research primarily focuses on **hybrid and indoor positioning**, **interoperability**, **linked data**, and methods for **discovering services**. Early in his career, he developed a fascination for integrating various technologies. Location data, in particular, offers a rich source for implicit human-computer interaction. However, he observed significant challenges in enabling seamless communication between different technologies. His focus on interoperability aims to bridge these gaps, facilitating effective and beneficial connections.

He graduated with great distinction from the [Erasmushogeschool Brussels](https://www.erasmushogeschool.be/en) in 2016, earning a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science. Subsequently, he obtained a Master of Science in Applied Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 2019, also with great distinction. His Master's thesis, titled *[Indoor Navigation by Centralized Tracking](/publications/2019/thesis)*, laid the foundation for his PhD research. Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Beat Signer, he is investigating hybrid positioning systems and the interoperability of these systems.

Maxim is a key contributor to the development of the open-source hybrid positioning system, [OpenHPS](https://openhps.org), which was launched in 2020. In 2022, he designed the [POSO ontology](https://poso.openhps.org), providing a vocabulary for describing positioning systems, their algorithms, and the data they produce. In 2023, he introduced the [SemBeacon](https://sembeacon.org) Bluetooth Low Energy specification, aimed at creating semantic beacons for tracking and describing persons, objects, and environments. He is currently working towards his dissertation on the Discoverability and Interoperability of Indoor Positioning Systems, which he expects to defend before the summer of 2025.

In addition to his PhD research, Maxim serves as a teaching assistant for various bachelor and master courses, including [Web Technologies](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/web-technologies), Databases, [Next Generation User Interfaces](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/next-generation-user-interfaces), and [Advanced Topics in Big Data](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/advanced-topics-big-data). He has also previously assisted in courses such as [Information Visualisation](https://wise.vub.ac.be/course/information-visualisation) and Open Information Systems. Furthermore, he supervises Bachelor and Master theses related to his research domain.

His current hobbies include additive manufacturing, electronics, and scuba diving. He is the creator and maintainer of the current website of the [V.U.B. Diving Center vzw](https://www.vubdivingcenter.be) and also helps beginning divers to prepare their pool exercises.
