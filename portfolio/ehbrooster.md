EhBRooster.be started as a project to address the lack of usability of the current timetables used by the Erasmushogeschool Brussel. The website quickly gained a lot of interest by both students and staff members. The website was developed in Java and PHP and was available at [ehbrooster.be](https://web.archive.org/web/20180812082356/https://ehbrooster.be/). The website is no longer available, but a snapshot of the website is available on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20180812082356/https://ehbrooster.be/). The website was discontinued in 2018 after successfully convincing the adoption of a new timetable system by both Erasmushogeschool and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

VUBRooster.be continued from EHBRooster.be and similarly was a project to address the lack of usability of the current timetables used by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (which was similar to the system used by Erasmushogeschool Brussel). The website was discontinued in 2018 after successfully convincing the adoption of a new timetable system by the university.
