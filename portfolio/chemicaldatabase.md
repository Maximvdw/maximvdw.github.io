excerpt: Development of an intranet database for storing and searching chemicals and other data.
type: job
cv: true

I was hired in 2014 as a student by [ChemStream BV.](https://chemstream.be) to develop a Web-based database for maintaining chemicals and their associated data. The database was developed in PHP and MySQL and has been in use since 2015. Chemical structure searching was based on [checkmol](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/norbert.haider/cheminf/cmmm.html) and matchmol.

In 2019, I took over the development with my company [MVdW-Software](https://mvdw-software.com) to containerise the database and to slowly move to a more stable Node.js backend logic and Vue3 frontend. Various extensions are still being developed on occasion and the database is still in use and maintained today. The software is made specifically for ChemStream and is not publicly available.
