I was hired in 2014 as a student by [ChemStream](https://chemstream.be) to develop a web-based database for maintaining chemicals and their data. The database was developed in PHP and MySQL and has been in use since 2015. Chemical structure searching was based on checkmol and matchmol.

In 2019, I took over the development with my company [MVdW-Software](https://mvdw-software.com) to containerize the database and to slowly move to a more stable Node.js backend logic. The database is still in use today and is maintained by me. The database and software was made specifically for ChemStream and is not publicly available.
