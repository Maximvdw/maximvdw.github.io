excerpt: "OpenHPS is an open source hybrid positioning system to help developers fuse various positioning technologies and algorithms. The system offers a modular data processing framework with each modules ranging from computer vision to common algorithms such as fingerprinting or data persistence of sampled data."

OpenHPS is an open source hybrid positioning system allowing developers to create a process network with graph topology to compute the position of a person or asset. We provide modules for different positioning methods (e.g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or visual positioning) and algorithms. These methods and algorithms are represented as nodes in the processing network. The core OpenHPS module is implemented in TypeScript and distributed in the CommonJS (CJS), ECMAScript (ESM) and Universal Module Definition (UMD) formats. This allows the processing network to run on a server, as a mobile application in the browser or even on embedded systems support JavaScript.

The project is ongoing and is part of my PhD research. More information can be found on the [OpenHPS website](https://openhps.org).
