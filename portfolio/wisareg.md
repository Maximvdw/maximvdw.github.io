My final work at my highschool was a project called WisaReg. WisaReg is a database migration tool to convert data from the [Wisa](https://www.wisa.be/) database to other internal databases. The tool aimed to help the ICT administrators to automatically create new user accounts in LDAP, Chamilio, Smartschool and other internal databases.

The project was developed in C# and was awarded the *best final work* of the my class in 2013 by *Don Bosco Hoboken*.
