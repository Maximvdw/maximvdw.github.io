excerpt: "I am an active member of the SpigotMC.org developer community. Having developed software that has been sold to more than 20,000 users since 2014"
---
I am an active member of the [SpigotMC.org](https://spigotmc.org) community and a previous member of the [Bukkit.org](https://bukkit.org) community. Since 2013, I have been developing popular free and paid plugins for the Minecraft server software. My plugins have been downloaded **over 100,000** times and were sold
to over **20,000 customers**.

My involvement in the community is slowly decreasing as I am focusing more on other projects, but I still maintain my plugins and provide support to my customers.
