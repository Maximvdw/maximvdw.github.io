summary: "Positioning systems determine the location of people and objects using various technologies and algorithms. While GPS dominates outdoor positioning, indoor and smaller-scale systems often require alternative technologies for lower latency, higher accuracy, or greater efficiency. These systems are frequently developed as single-use prototypes with no standard data format, hindering reusability and expansion. OpenHPS addresses these challenges by providing a modular, graph-based framework for creating versatile positioning systems on multiple platforms. It supports a wide range of algorithms and enables extensibility through custom nodes for sensor fusion and algorithm integration."
