Hybrid positioning frameworks use various sensors
and algorithms to enhance positioning through different types
of fusion. The optimisation of the fusion process requires the
testing of different algorithm parameters and optimal lowas well as high-level sensor fusion techniques. The presented
OpenHPS open source hybrid positioning system is a modular
framework managing individual nodes in a process network,
which can be configured to support concrete positioning use
cases or to adapt to specific technologies. This modularity allows
developers to rapidly develop and optimise their positioning
system while still providing them the flexibility to add their
own algorithms. In this paper we discuss how a process network
developed with OpenHPS can be used to realise a customisable
indoor positioning solution with an offline and online stage, and
how it can be adapted for high accuracy or low latency. For the
demonstration and validation of our indoor positioning solution,
we further compiled a publicly available dataset containing data
from WLAN access points, BLE beacons as well as several
trajectories that include IMU data.
