Augmented Reality (AR) environments are physical environments with virtual objects superimposed
through AR-enabled devices. These virtual objects can range from simple aesthetic objects like pictures
to superimposed contextual information about physical items. In most modern AR applications, the
augmented spaces exist only for the user who created the environment or for proprietary applications
that enable multi-user collaboration in the same environment. However, there is a lack of solutions that
enable interoperable collaboration in these personal AR spaces, allowing users to share and contribute
to an AR space. We propose a solution that enables users to create their personal AR space that can
then be discovered by other users who are in physical proximity to this space, enabling them to view or
contribute to the augmented space. In addition, we discuss a solution that utilises the same technique
to create AR spaces that are bound to a specific room and can be discovered by users who are in close
vicinity to these rooms.
