WisaReg is an application that provides newly registered students from the Wisa database with accounts for various services. The system creates accounts for Windows Active Directory, the Virtual Learning Platform, the student tracking system, and also for a Gmail email address. Wisa is an administration package that most schools use to manage student and staff administration. The data created with this is saved in a Firebird SQL database. As soon as a password is changed somewhere, it will also change across all services, and when a student is deregistered, their accounts will also be deleted due to some limitations.
